Distribution function F(x) A Function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is equal to or less than some value. Frequency The rate at which something occurs or is repeated over a particular period of time or in a given sample. Gamma Distribution A two parameter family of continous probability distributions that is defined by a shape and scale parameter. Maximum Liklihood Estimator The maximum likelihood estimator (mle) for ? is any maximizer of the likelihood; in a sense the mle chooses the parameter value that best explains the observed observations Mixture A probabilistic combination of two or more probability distributions Moment generating function A real function whose derivatives at zero are equal to the moments of the random variable. Negative binomial Poisson A discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occuring in a fixed interval of time or space if these evetns occur with a known constant rate and independently of the time since the last event. Probability generating function A power series representation of the probability mass function of the random variable. Probability mass function f(x) A Function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. Severity The amount of damage that is (or that may be) inflicted by a loss or catastrophe. Survival function S(x) A function that gives the probability that an object of interest will survive beyond a specified time. Zero Modifided Distribution A modified member of the (a,b,0) class that has had its probability mass at 0 modified in some way. The rest of the probability masses are adjsuted to accomadate this modification. Zero Truncated Distribution A modified member of the (a,b,0) class that has a probability mass of 0 at 0. The rest of the probability masses are adjsuted to accomadate this modification. "],
