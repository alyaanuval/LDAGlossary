Click “Submit new issue”. 1.2 Terms and Definitions by Chapter Here is a list of important terms and their definitions listed according to the chapters in which they are found. 1.2.1 Chapter 1 Introduction to Loss Data Analytics Term Definition loss adjustment expenses Loss adjustment expenses are costs to the insurer that are directly attributable to settling a claims. For example, the cost of an adjuster is someone who assess the claim cost or a lawyer who becomes involve in settling an insurer’s legal obligation on a claim unallocated loss adjustment expenses Unallocated loss adjustment expenses are costs that can only be indirectly attributed to claim settlement; for example, the cost of an office to support claims staff allocated loss adjustment expenses Allocated loss adjustment expenses, sometimes known by the acronym ALEA, are costs that can be directly attributed to settling a claim; for example, the cost of an adjuster indemnification Indemnification is the compensation provided by the insurer. insurance claim An insurance claim is the compensation provided by the insurer for incurred hurt, loss, or damage that is covered by the policy. loss amount The loss amount is the size of the loss incurred by the policyholder for incurred hurt, loss, or damage that is covered by the policy. analytics Analytics is the process of using data to make decisions. renters insurance Renters insurance is an insurance policy that covers the contents of an apartment or house that you are renting. homeowners insurance Homeowners insurance is an insurance policy that covers the contents and property of a building that is owned by you or a friend. automobile insurance An insurance policy that covers damage to your vehicle, damage to other vehicles in the accident, as well as medical expenses of those injured in the accident. property insurance Property insurance is a policy that protects the insured against loss or damage to real or personal property. The cause of loss might be fire, lightening, business interruption, loss of rents, glass breakage, tornado, windstorm, hail, water damage, explosion, riot, civil commotion, rain, or damage from aircraft or vehicles. nonlife insurance Nonlife insurance is any type of insurance where payments are not based on the death (or survivorship) of a named insured. Examples include automobile, homeowners, and so on. Also known as property and casualty or general insurance. casualty insurance Causalty insurance is a form of liability insurance providing coverage for negligent acts and omissions. Examples include workers compensation, errors and omissions, fidelity, crime, glass, boiler, and various malpractice coverages. valuation date A valuation date is the date at which a company summarizes its financial position, typically quarterly or annually. underwriting Underwriting is the process where the company makes a decision as to whether or not to take on a risk. ratemaking reinsurer A reinsurer is an insurance company that offers insurance to an insurer. loss reserve A loss reserve is an estimate of liability indicating the amount the insurer expects to pay for claims that have not yet been realized. This includes losses incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) and those claims that have been reported claims that haven’t been paid (known by the acronym RBNS for reported but not settled). technical provisions Technical provisions is another name for loss reserves. experience rating merit rating risk classification Risk classification is the process of grouping policyholders into categories, or classes, where each insured in the class has a risk profile that is similar to others in the class. cream skimming claims triage pure premium Pure premium is the total severity divided by the number of claims. It does not include insurance company expenses, premium taxes, contingencies, nor an allowance for profits. Also called loss costs. Some definitions include allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE). loss cost Loss cost is the total severity divided by the number of claims. It does not include insurance company expenses, premium taxes, contingencies, nor an allowance for profits. Also called pure premium. Some definitions include allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE). rating variables coinsurance Coinsurance is an arrangement whereby the insured and insurer share the covered losses. Typically, a coinsurance parameter specified means that both parties receive a proportional share, e.g., 50%, of the loss. deductible A deductible is a parameter specified in the contract. Typically, losses below the deductible are paid by the policyholder whereas losses in excess of the deductible are the insurer’s responsibility (subject to policy limits and coninsurance). policy limit A policy limit is the maximum value covered by a policy. personal lines dividend A dividend is the refund of a portion of the premium paid by the insured from insurer surplus. bonus retrospective premiums The process of determining the cost of an insurance policy based on the actual loss experience determined as an adjustment to the initial premium payment. prospective premiums claims adjustment Claims adjustment is the process of determining coverage, legal liability, and settling claims. Commercial line Commercial line is insurance purchased by commercial ventures (businesses) line of business A line of business is a classification of business written by insurers. claims leakage Claims leakage respresents money lost through claims management inefficiencies. fraud detection case reserve A case reserve is an estimate of the insurer’s future liability made by the claims adjuster. adjuster An adjuster is a person who investigates claims and recommends settlement options based on estimates of damage and insurance policies held. life Insurance Life insurance is a contract where the insurer promises to pay upon the death of an insured person. The person being paid is the beneficiary. capital allocation 1.2.2 Chapter 2 Frequency Modeling Term Definition aggregate claims The sum of all claims observed in a period of time Bernoulli distribution A special case of the binomial distribution where the number of trials is equal to 1, leading to only 2 potential outcomes: success or failure Binomial distribution A Frequency distribution of the possible nuber of successful outcomes in a given number of trials in each of which there is the same probability of success. Distribution function F(x) A Function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is equal to or less than some value. Frequency The rate at which something occurs or is repeated over a particular period of time or in a given sample. Gamma Distribution A two parameter family of continous probability distributions that is defined by a shape and scale parameter. Maximum Liklihood Estimator The maximum likelihood estimator (mle) for ÃŽÂ¸ is any maximizer of the likelihood; in a sense the mle chooses the parameter value that best explains the observed observations Mixture A probabilistic combination of two or more probability distributions Moment generating function A real function whose derivatives at zero are equal to the moments of the random variable. Negative binomial Poisson A discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occuring in a fixed interval of time or space if these evetns occur with a known constant rate and independently of the time since the last event. Probability generating function A power series representation of the probability mass function of the random variable. Probability mass function f(x) A Function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. Severity The amount of damage that is (or that may be) inflicted by a loss or catastrophe. Survival function S(x) A function that gives the probability that an object of interest will survive beyond a specified time. Zero Modifided Distribution A modified member of the (a,b,0) class that has had its probability mass at 0 modified in some way. The rest of the probability masses are adjsuted to accomadate this modification. Zero Truncated Distribution A modified member of the (a,b,0) class that has a probability mass of 0 at 0. The rest of the probability masses are adjsuted to accomadate this modification. 1.2.3 Chapter 5 Aggregate Loss Models Term Definition aggregate claims The sum of all claims observed in a period of time deductible A deductible is a parameter specified in the contract. Typically, losses below the deductible are paid by the policyholder whereas losses in excess of the deductible are the insurer’s responsibility (subject to policy limits and coninsurance). coinsurance Coinsurance is an arrangement whereby the insured and insurer share the covered losses. Typically, a coinsurance parameter specified means that both parties receive a proportional share, e.g., 50%, of the loss. inflation Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services over a period of time. policy limit A policy limit is the maximum value covered by a policy. line of business A line of business is a classification of business written by insurers. individual risk model A modeling approach for aggregate losses in which the loss from each individual contract is considered. collective risk model A modeling approach for aggregate losses in which the aggregate loss is represented in terms of a frequency distribution and a severity distribution. coverage Insurance coverage is the amount of risk or liability that is covered for an individual or entity by an insurance policy. exposure A measure of the rating units for which rates are applied to determine the premium. For example, exposures may be measured on a per unit basis (e.g. a family with auto insurance under one contract may have an exposure of 2 cars) or per $1,000 of value (e.g. homeowners insurance). frequency distribution The random number of claims that occur under the collective risk model. severity distribution The randomly distributed amount of each loss under the collective risk model. term life insurance A term life insurance policy is payable only if death of the insured occurs within a specified time, such as 5 or 10 years, or before a specified age. pure endowment A pure endowment is an insurance policy that is payable at the end of the policy period if the insured is still alive. If the insured has died, there is nothing paid in the form of benefits. support (of a distribution) The set of all outcomes for a random variable following some distribution. For example, exponentially distributed random variable X has support x&gt;0. central limit theorem Given certain conditions, the arithmetic mean of a large number of replications of independent random variables, each with a finite mean and variance, will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution. convolution The convolution of probability distributions is the distribution corresponding to the addition of independent random variables. law of iterated expectations A decomposition of the expected value of a random variable into conditional components. Specifically, for random variables X and Y, E(X) = E[E(X|Y)]. law of total variance A decomposition of the variance of a random variable into conditional components. Specifically, for random variables X and Y on the same probability space, Var(X) = E[Var(Y|X)] + Var[E(X|Y)]. compound distribution A random variable follows a compound distribution if it is parameterized and contains at least one parameter that is itself a random variable. For example, the Tweedie distribution is a compound distribution. Tweedie distribution A compound distribution that is a Poisson sum of Gamma random variables. Because it can accommodate a discrete probability mass at zero and a continuous positive component, it is suitable for modeling aggregate insurance claims. shape parameter A numerical parameter of a parametric distribution affecting the shape of a distribution rather than simply shifting it (as a location parameter does) or stretching/shrinking it (as a scale parameter does). scale parameter A numerical parameter of a parametric distribution that stretches/shrinks the distribution without changing its location or shape. The larger the scale parameter, the more spread out the distribution. The scale parameter is also the reciprocal of the rate parameter. For example, the normal distribution has scale parameter . exponential dispersion model A set of distributions that represents a generalisation of the natural exponential family and also plays an important role in generalized linear models. generalized linear model Commonly known by the acronym GLM. An extension of the linear regression model where the dependent variable is a member of the linear exponential family. GLM encompasses linear, binary, count, and long-tailed, regressions all as special cases. exponential family A family of parametric distributions that are practical for modeling the underlying response variable in generalized linear models. This family includes the normal, Bernoulli, Poisson, and Tweedie distributions as special cases, among many others. Monte Carlo simulation A computerized statistical model that simulates the effects of various types of uncertainty. empirical distribution The empirical distribution is a non-parametric estimate of the underlying distribution of a random variable. It directly uses the data observations to construct the distribution, with each observed data point in a size-n sample having probability 1/n. convergence (almost surely) A type of stochastic convergence for a sequence of random variables X_1,â€¦, X_n that approaches some other distribution as n approaches . ground-up loss The total amount of loss sustained before policy adjustments are made (i.e. before deductions are applied for coinsurance, deductibles, and/or policy limits.) per-loss basis Due to policy modifications (e.g. deductibles), not all losses that occur result in payment. The per-loss basis considers every loss that occurs, as opposed to the per-payment basis which considers only the losses that result in some payment to the insured. per-payment basis Due to policy modifications (e.g. deductibles), not all losses that occur result in payment. The per-loss basis considers every loss that occurs, as opposed to the per-payment basis which considers only the losses that result in some payment to the insured. memoryless The memoryless property means that a given probability distribution is independent of its history and what has already elapsed. Specifically, random variable X is memoryless if Pr(X &gt; s+t | X &gt;= s) = Pr(X &gt; t). Note that it does not mean X &gt; s+t and X &gt;= s are independent events. 1.3 Terms and Chapter First Defined Certain terms are defined multiple times throughout the book, so this list can help the reader refer to the chapter in which a term is first used and defined.

["S-NotationConvention.html", "3 Conventions for Notation 3.1 General Conventions 3.2 Abbreviations 3.3 Common Statistical Symbols and Operators 3.4 Common Mathematical Symbols and Functions 3.5 Further Readings", " 3 Conventions for Notation Chapter Preview. Loss Data Analytics will serve as a bridge between actuarial problems and methods and widely accepted statistical concepts and tools. Thus, the notation should be consistent with standard usage employed in probability and mathematical statistics. See, for example, (Halperin, Hartley, and Hoel 1965) for a description of one standard. 3.1 General Conventions Random variables are denoted by upper-case italicized Roman letters, with \\(X\\) or \\(Y\\) denoting a claim size variable, \\(N\\) a claim count variable, and \\(S\\) an aggregate loss variable. Realizations of random variables are denoted by corresponding lower-case italicized Roman letters, with \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) for claim sizes, \\(n\\) for a claim count, and \\(s\\) for an aggregate loss. Probability events are denoted by upper-case Roman letters, such as \\(\\Pr(\\mathrm{A})\\) for the probability that an outcome in the event ‘’A’’ occurs. Cumulative probability functions are denoted by \\(F(z)\\) and probability density functions by the associated lower-case Roman letter: \\(f(z)\\). For distributions, parameters are denoted by lower-case Greek letters. A caret or ‘’hat’’ indicates a sample estimate of the corresponding population parameter. For example, \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is an estimate of \\(\\beta\\) . The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers, say, \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\), is usually denoted by \\(\\bar{x}\\); the use of \\(x\\), of course, is optional. Use upper-case boldface Roman letters to denote a matrix other than a vector. Use lower-case boldface Roman letters to denote a (column) vector. Use a superscript prime ‘’\\(\\prime\\)’’ for transpose. For example, \\(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}\\) is a quadratic form. Acronyms are to be used sparingly, given the international focus of our audience. Introduce acronyms commonly used in statistical nomenclature but limit the number of acronyms introduced. For example, pdf for probability density function is useful but GS for Gini statistic is not. 3.2 Abbreviations Here is a list of abbreviations that we adopt. We italicize these acronyms. For example, we can discuss the goodness of fit in terms of the AIC criterion. \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\hline AIC &amp; \\text{Akaike information criterion} \\\\ BIC &amp; \\text{(Schwarz) Bayesian information criterion} \\\\ cdf &amp; \\text{cumulative distribution function} \\\\ df &amp; \\text{degrees of freedom} \\\\ iid &amp; \\text{independent and identically distributed} \\\\ glm &amp; \\text{generalized linear model} \\\\ mle &amp; \\text{maximum likelihood estimate}\\\\ ols &amp; \\text{ordinary least squares} \\\\ pdf &amp; \\text{probability density function} \\\\ pf &amp; \\text{probability function} \\\\ pmf &amp; \\text{probability mass function} \\\\ rv &amp; \\text{random variable} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] 3.3 Common Statistical Symbols and Operators Here is a list of commonly used statistical symbols and operators, including the latex code that we use to generate them (in the parens). \\[ \\begin{array}{cl} \\hline I(\\cdot) &amp; \\text{binary indicator operator (}I\\text{).
