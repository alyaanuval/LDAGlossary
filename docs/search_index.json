This includes losses incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) and those claims that have been reported claims that haven’t been paid (known by the acronym RBNS for reported but not settled). technical provisions Technical provisions is another name for loss reserves. experience rating merit rating risk classification Risk classification is the process of grouping policyholders into categories, or classes, where each insured in the class has a risk profile that is similar to others in the class. cream skimming claims triage pure premium Pure premium is the total severity divided by the number of claims. It does not include insurance company expenses, premium taxes, contingencies, nor an allowance for profits. Also called loss costs. Some definitions include allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE). loss cost Loss cost is the total severity divided by the number of claims. It does not include insurance company expenses, premium taxes, contingencies, nor an allowance for profits. Also called pure premium. Some definitions include allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE). rating variables coinsurance Coinsurance is an arrangement whereby the insured and insurer share the covered losses. Typically, a coinsurance parameter specified means that both parties receive a proportional share, e.g., 50%, of the loss. deductible A deductible is a parameter specified in the contract. Typically, losses below the deductible are paid by the policyholder whereas losses in excess of the deductible are the insurer’s responsibility (subject to policy limits and coninsurance). policy limit A policy limit is the maximum value covered by a policy. personal lines dividend A dividend is the refund of a portion of the premium paid by the insured from insurer surplus. bonus retrospective premiums The process of determining the cost of an insurance policy based on the actual loss experience determined as an adjustment to the initial premium payment. prospective premiums claims adjustment Claims adjustment is the process of determining coverage, legal liability, and settling claims. Commercial line Commercial line is insurance purchased by commercial ventures (businesses) line of business A line of business is a classification of business written by insurers. claims leakage Claims leakage respresents money lost through claims management inefficiencies. fraud detection case reserve A case reserve is an estimate of the insurer’s future liability made by the claims adjuster. adjuster An adjuster is a person who investigates claims and recommends settlement options based on estimates of damage and insurance policies held. life Insurance Life insurance is a contract where the insurer promises to pay upon the death of an insured person. The person being paid is the beneficiary. capital allocation 1.2 Chapter 2 Terms Term Description Aggregate Claims The sum of all claims observed in a period of time Bernoulli distribution A special case of the binomial distribution where the number of trials is equal to 1, leading to only 2 potential outcomes: success or failure Binomial distribution A Frequency distribution of the possible nuber of successful outcomes in a given number of trials in each of which there is the same probability of success. Distribution function F(x) A Function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is equal to or less than some value. Frequency The rate at which something occurs or is repeated over a particular period of time or in a given sample. Gamma Distribution A two parameter family of continous probability distributions that is defined by a shape and scale parameter. Maximum Liklihood Estimator The maximum likelihood estimator (mle) for ? is any maximizer of the likelihood; in a sense the mle chooses the parameter value that best explains the observed observations Mixture A probabilistic combination of two or more probability distributions Moment generating function A real function whose derivatives at zero are equal to the moments of the random variable. Negative binomial Poisson A discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occuring in a fixed interval of time or space if these evetns occur with a known constant rate and independently of the time since the last event. Probability generating function A power series representation of the probability mass function of the random variable. Probability mass function f(x) A Function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. Severity The amount of damage that is (or that may be) inflicted by a loss or catastrophe. Survival function S(x) A function that gives the probability that an object of interest will survive beyond a specified time. Zero Modifided Distribution A modified member of the (a,b,0) class that has had its probability mass at 0 modified in some way. The rest of the probability masses are adjsuted to accomadate this modification. Zero Truncated Distribution A modified member of the (a,b,0) class that has a probability mass of 0 at 0. The rest of the probability masses are adjsuted to accomadate this modification. "],
