What is being described,Description,"Chapter 
first mentioned"
analytics,"The process of using data to make decisions.
This process involves gathering data, understanding models of uncertainty,making general inferences, and communicating results",1
business intelligence,"May focus on processes of collecting data, often through databases and data warehouses",1
business analytics,Utilizes tools and methods for statistical analyses of data,1
data science,Can encompass broader applications in many scientific domains,1
short-term,Contracts where the insurance coverage is typically provided for six months or a year,1
property insurance,"In the US, policies such as renters and homeowners ",1
casualty insurance,"In the US, a policy such as auto that covers medical damages to people ",1
nonlife or general insurance,"In the rest of the world, property and casualty insurance are both known as nonlife or general insurance, to distinguish them from life insurance",1
Underwriting,"The process of classifying risks into homogenous categoriesand assigning policyholders to these categories, lies at the core of ratemaking. 
Policyholders within a class have similar risk profiles and so are charged thesame insurance price",1
ratemaking,Where analysts seek to determine the right price for the right risk,1
"experience rating or 
merit rating",Modifying premiums with claims history,1
claims adjustment,"The process of determining coverage, legal liability, and settling claims ",1
claims leakage,Dollars lost through claims management inefficiencies,1
loss reserving,Setting aside money for unpaid claims ,1
claim,"At a fundamental level, insurance companies accept premiums in exchange for promises to indemnify a policyholder upon the uncertain 
occurrence of an insured event. This indemnification is known as a claim",1
severity,"A positive amount is a key financial expenditure for an insurer. So, knowing only the claim amount summarizes the reimbursement to the policyholder",1
frequency,How often claims arise,1
pure premium or loss cost,The total severity divided by the number of claims ,1
rating variables,Externally available variables useful in setting insurance rates and premiums,1
claim,compensation from insurer to insured upon the occurrence of an insured event,
Frequency,how often claims arise or how often insured event occurs,2
Severity,amount of each payment for an insured event ,2
expected cost,expected number of claims (frequency) times expected amount per claim (severity),2
binomial distribution,"discrete frequency distribution and member of (a, b, 0) class; for number of successes in a fixed number of independent identical trials with binary outcomes",2
negative binomial distribution,"discrete frequency distribution and member of (a, b, 0) class; for number of successes until we observe the  r-th failure in independent identical trials with binary outcomes",
poisson distribution,"discrete frequency distribution and member of (a, b, 0) class; for independent events occuring at a constant rate in a certain time period",2
likelihood,observed value of mass function,
"maximum likelihood 
estimator (mle)",to find parameter values that produce the largest likelihood,2
risk,a unit covered by insurance,
parameter,a numerical characteristic of a population,
mixture,"mixture of subgroups, each with their own distribution",
fitted distribution,distribution used for modeling the data,
Pearson chi-square statistic,to check for the goodness of fit of the fitted distribution,
