What is being described,Description of term
Aggregate Claims,The sum of all claims observed in a period of time
Bernoulli distribution,"A special case of the binomial distribution where the number of trials is equal to 1, leading to only 2 potential outcomes: success or failure"
Binomial distribution,A Frequency distribution of the possible nuber of successful outcomes in a given number of trials in each of which there is the same probability of success.
Distribution function F(x),A Function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is equal to or less than some value.
Frequency,The rate at which something occurs or is repeated over a particular period of time or in a given sample.
Gamma Distribution,A two parameter family of continous probability distributions that is defined by a shape and scale parameter.
Maximum Liklihood Estimator,The maximum likelihood estimator (mle) for ? is any maximizer of the likelihood; in a sense the mle chooses the parameter value that best explains the observed observations
Mixture,A probabilistic combination of two or more probability distributions
Moment generating function,A real function whose derivatives at zero are equal to the moments of the random variable.
Negative binomial,
Poisson,A discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occuring in a fixed interval of time or space if these evetns occur with a known constant rate and independently of the time since the last event.
Probability generating function,A power series representation of the probability mass function of the random variable.
Probability mass function f(x),A Function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.
Severity,The amount of damage that is (or that may be) inflicted by a loss or catastrophe.
Survival function S(x),A function that gives the probability that an object of interest will survive beyond a specified time.
Zero Modifided Distribution,"A modified member of the (a,b,0) class that has had its probability mass at 0 modified in some way. The rest of the probability masses are adjsuted to accomadate this modification."
Zero Truncated Distribution,"A modified member of the (a,b,0) class that has a probability mass of 0 at 0. The rest of the probability masses are adjsuted to accomadate this modification."
